# Build & run

To build and run this project, you need the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) installed.

The project can be built using `npm build` and then run using `npm start`. NPM can be replaced with Yarn, which should resolve dependencies faster. Do note that Yarn will still use `ng` as specified in the `package.json` file.
